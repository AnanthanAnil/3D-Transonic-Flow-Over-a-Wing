## ðŸš€ About Me
Mechanical Engineer with the experience and technical expertise to provide the highest quality mechanical component and system support. Skilled at formulating and implementing equipment designs, testing and producing specifications, and researching product application.


# Ansys project

 1. Perform a 3D transonic turbulent CFD Simulation
 
 2. Create a three-dimensional mesh using techniques to strategically refine the mesh
 3. Obtain iterative convergence by using recommended solver settings
 4. Visualize 3D flow characteristics to gain physical insights
 5. Verify and validate simulation results by comparing with experimental data and NASA 
 CFD results
